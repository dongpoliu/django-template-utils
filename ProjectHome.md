A library of useful template-related functionality for [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) applications.

There are two ways to download: one is to follow the download link on the right-hand side of this page, and do the following:

```
tar zxvf template_utils-0.4p2.tar.gz
cd template_utils-0.4p2
python setup.py install
```

The other is to do a Subversion checkout somewhere on your Python path:

```
svn checkout http://django-template-utils.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/template_utils/
```

Full documentation is available [online](http://django-template-utils.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/), or in the `docs/` directory of the package.

This application is still under development, and not yet tested in all situations; bug reports (click the "Issues" tab above) are appreciated.
